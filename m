Thanks for the answer Paolo, I took note of all the points you mentioned.

Regarding the future direction, I would be happy to see an 
"experimental" binary, without any symlink set for now. Beyond filtering 
we can implement or not, my understanding was that people involved were 
not in favor to see -target option.

A solution we could have is indeed to expose all machines/cpus/devices 
(knowing it will very quickly create more problems with QOM types having 
duplicated names - riscv64 vs aarch64), and let user pick any 
combination. However, we still need a -target option to set the correct 
TargetInfo internally, independently of all the rest.

I'll let someone else do a proposal on the topic as I spent a lot of 
energy on this with a specific direction (option + filtering) without 
reaching consensus, and I'll be happy to follow any direction that will 
be accepted by the community.

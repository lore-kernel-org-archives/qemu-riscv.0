I asked on the Fedora development lists for feedback on the idea of
dropping QEMU 32-bit host support

  https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject=
.org/thread/TPAVIC6YANGP2NK4RUOP7OCIOIFIOV3A/

The response was rather underwhealming to say the least, with only one
person explicitly expressing a desire for QEMU to keep 32-bit host
support for armv7l.

The main interesting thing I learnt was that even with 64-bit Raspberry
Pi hardware, it can be desirable to run 32-bit Raspberry Pi supporting
distro, supposedly for performance benefits.

I know nothing about TCG internals, but Is it viable to implement int128_=
t
support only in 64-bit host, leaving 32-bit hosts without it ? Or is this
really a blocking item that is holding back 64-bit host features.

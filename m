Possible! Calling the Cocoa UI APIs from anything other than the main
thread has never officially been supported as far as I'm aware, but perhaps
some subset silently worked on earlier releases. Modern versions definitely
enforce the rule to some extent.

Also I find it strange to require UI backends to NULL init a global. If

Well, that's the whole point, it's not just the Cocoa UI - other macOS
system frameworks also need a runloop or libdispatch to be handling events
on thread 0. Relevant here are the ParavirtualizedGraphics.framework that's
integrated with patches 2-4 from this patch set, as well as the
Metal.framework, which PVG uses internally, and which we need to use
directly to some extent to complete the generated guest frames. These
frameworks internally use libdispatch, and they just don't work if nothing
is processing events on the main dispatch queue/runloop. So without patch
01/16, PV graphics will only work in conjunction with Cocoa or SDL, because
those do process the runloop on the main thread. But if you were to run
with -nographic, or VNC/SPICE-only, Mac PV graphics just wouldn't work. So
the idea is to uncouple the main thread's runloop from the Cocoa UI.

An then, the GTK+ and SDL libraries themselves call down into Cocoa on
macOS. Windows also has specific rules about its Win32 UI API and
threading. SDL says outright that everything needs to be done from the main
thread. GTK+ says everything needs to be called from a single thread on
Win32; it seems like the rule on macOS is the same, except that thread must
be thread 0. Both those UIs in Qemu seem to violate the threading rules of
the libraries they integrate, as evidenced by the bug reports listed above.
This brokenness is entirely independent of this patch set here, it's just
that we're bumping up against the same underlying issue of needing runloop
handling on thread 0 in macOS.

With regard to NULL'ing the qemu_main function pointer from the SDL or GTK
UIs in Qemu: I had implemented a different approach to solving the problem
in v4, where each UI declared up-front what kind of threading arrangement
it needed rather than each one just overwriting a global variable. This was
somewhat more complex than the current one though.
https://patchew.org/QEMU/20241024102813.9855-1-phil@philjordan.eu/202410241=
02813.9855-2-phil@philjordan.eu/

Ultimately, it seems like someone needs to take a look at the SDL and GTK
integrations in Qemu and rework them in a way that doesn't violate the SDL
and GTK+ libraries' own threading rules. Once we've figured out what
requirements fall out of that, we can tidy up the qemu_main arrangement.

But that's an undertaking that's out of scope for this patch - I see the
current patch as a step towards a global solution to the problem.
Definitely not the last word on the matter, but at least starting to get
away from the situation where each UI does whatever it wants with zero
regard for the rest of the code base.

Please stop.  Just stop.  "It came from multiple people" never ends well.

I have my own disagreements with Daniel, which is no surprise since I've 
known him at work for over 15 years.  In fact, we probably had a couple 
just this week, though that's fortunately above average.  We have 
different personalities, we come from different cultural backgrounds. 
We are still able to respect each other and I seek his opinion even if 
(or sometimes because) I know it'll be different and make things harder 
for me. :)

I'll briefly touch the technical part.  As it was explained, the problem 
is really just in the use of symlinks for aarch64 and riscv64 binaries.

All that Daniel is *asking for* is to split the experimental part from 
the existing one.  Did he go on a tangent on what else he'd like from 
the experimental part?  Yes, but that's simply a justification for why 
it's better to keep it split.

Yes, and that's fine.

I have a different memory.  While I am also satisfied with the outcome, 
I remember that it was hard to explain why you couldn't just drop 
-fms-bitfields, and what analysis was required before you did that.  And 
the outcome was positive mostly (or only) because *I* did the analysis 
that was necessary to ensure there would be no regressions with *your* 
proposed patch.

What Daniel is asking is even less - he's only asking to *remove* the 
bits that symlink qemu-system-arm and qemu-system-riscv64 into 
qemu-system.  (Perhaps you could do that with a configure option 
instead, btw, that's also a possibility and would make CI integration 
easier).

This is simply not true. The important part: "We don't have to do all 
that straightaway. If we declare qemu-system 'experimental' initially we 
can iterate on that intentionally breaking compat in releases, without 
any impact on qemu-system-$TARGET".

Experimental doesn't mean unusable.

That's exactly what Daniel suggested.  In fact the same is true for more 
things than just the command line:

- filtering can be applied (if needed at all) to qemu-system *after* the 
binary is available in qemu.git, exactly because qemu-system is 
experimental;

- if we decide later that -target is not always needed, that would also 
be doable after the merge.

I hope this helps not so much solving the technical disagreement, but 
clarifying that yes, sometimes you've got to "agree to disagree", but 
personal attacks of any intensity are not "agreeing to disagree".

Paolo

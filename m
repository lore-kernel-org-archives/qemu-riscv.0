yes, it's clunky and verbose but it's uniform for all cpus,
which is doubly important for machine users and other interface QEMU
has to communicate with users.

secondly, adding set of symbols to cpu name (ideally it should be cpu's typename)
complicates parsing and adds one more user to the old compat hooks, which
prevents us from deprecating those.
We've put a lot of of effort in consolidating these parts across QEMU,
so adding yet another custom way to parse -cpu looks like regression to me.

I'd go for this one as it's less controversial and follows common patterns.
Human users can write a wrapper script if necessary.

Right, I missed when you run the thorough/slow tests trough make, then the 
meson wrapped qos-test call is guarded by a timeout, which currently is set to 
120s for the *entire* qos-test suite (tests/qtest/meson.build), which is fine 
for regular tests, but insufficient for these new slow 9p race tests.

I thought timeouts were just a thing for the official in-cloud QEMU CI 
pipeline - which doesn't run any slow test at all, so no problem there.
That was actually the point why I explictly registered these new race tests as 
"slow" ones in the first place.

This is more of a project management question; should these extremely slow 9p 
race tests either:

a) be skipped entirely on `make check-qtest SPEED=thorough` or
b) run shorter (i.e. less rounds, very low probability to hit) or
c) increase the meson timeout for qos-test binary?

Personally I don't care too much. These 9p race tests are useful for me, but I 
also understand if other unrelated developers don't want to spend like 10+ 
mins on each test run for this. I still run them directly via `tests/qtest/
qos-test -m slow` ; last line of defense, etc.

Technically it is easy to address:

a) -> set envvar V9FS_RACE=0
b) -> set envvar V9FS_RACE_ROUNDS=n
c) -> s/'qos-test': 120/'qos-test': n/

all in tests/qtest/meson.build. Your call.

It is not a surprise, I'm just examining the effect.

Building custom minimized QEMU is not a path that works for
distro vendors, as we can't tailor to distinct use cases,
so the footprint of the generic build and any impact on our
packaging is a factor I'm interested in.

The 'modules' feature came out of our work to lower the
footprint of a default "all features" QEMU build.

As long as qemu-system-$target stays around as its current
impl, it isn't a blocker. If qemu-system-$target were changed
into a symlink to qemu-system, then it becomes a critical path
problem for the distro packaging.

I think the solution long term is to further expand the use
of modules to more of the code.

We don't have sufficient testing, nor is the current QEMU
qemu-system-$target especially good from a design POV as
it has decades of historical baggage holding us back. The
introduction of a new binary is the ideal time to address
this long term problem. It frees us to do changes that are
otherwise impossible and to experiment with new ideas
without worrying about implications for the current binaries
and their users.

With regards,
Daniel

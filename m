Hi chihmin,

Thank you for the detailed and informative response. You have a very 
good understanding of the specifications.

I will modify the code according to the latest spec(currently 
riscv-v-spec 0.7.2) from the ISA spec git repo as Alistair advised.

Yours,

Zhiwei

            First, please provide the link to the specifications. Via
            Google, I found<br>
            that "riscv-v-spec-0.7.1" is titled "Working draft of the
            proposed RISC-V V<br>

            <br>
            I am not sure what the QEMU policy towards "working draft

            specification is. Peter, can you perhaps clarify that or any

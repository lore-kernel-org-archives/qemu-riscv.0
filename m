No, it looks good to me.

Could that be differently confusing?  Honest question!

1. Correct get_maintainers.pl output

   Appears to be fine.  As far as I can tell, it accumulates S: for all
   matching sections.  A matching section without S: should be harmless
   as long as another matching section provides one.

   By the way, this is another reason why my patch was bad.  The S:
   Orphan gets accumulated, and can lead to problematic output, e.g.

    $ scripts/get_maintainer.pl --status -f hw/virtio/vhost-user-scmi.c=20
    Milan Zamazal <mzamazal@redhat.com> (reviewer:vhost-user-scmi)
    "Michael S. Tsirkin" <mst@redhat.com> (supporter:vhost)
    Stefano Garzarella <sgarzare@redhat.com> (reviewer:vhost)
    qemu-devel@nongnu.org (open list:All patches CC here)
    Orphan
    Supported

2. Legible MAINTAINERS

   S: Supported is without supporters is mildly confusing unless you
   understand that the supporters are listed elsewhere.  Evidence: it
   confused me.

   No S: looks like we forgot to add it.  Feels less bad to me, but I
   might be biased.  Could it use a comment?  Not sure.

   Hmm, S: Supported could even be misleading.  Say Milan had agreed to
   look after this in his spare time.  That's status Maintained.  We'd
   use M: to record his commitment.  But what S: to use?

   S: Maintained gives M: the correct meaning, but mislead readers about
   the status of the matched files: these are still Supported.

   S: Supported is locally correct about the status of the matched
   files, but misleads about the M:.

   I think in this case we'd use M: Maintained as the lesser evil.

   The reliable way to find out status is running get_maintainers.pl.

I guess the "vhost-" in "vhost-user-scmi" is enough of a hint.

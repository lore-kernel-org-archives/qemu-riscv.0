I could add caches for the Ascalon core complex in Atlantis but the
topology is pretty simple with just private L1 and shared L2. The
tt-atlantis machine is also device tree only, so it would not produce a
PPTT or RQSC table. A generic cpu with L1, L2 and L3 caches like Sunil
defined is ideal for testing my Qemu RQSC series [1], since RQSC needs
to reference cache IDs from PPTT. My plan is to rebase my RQSC series
once PPTT support lands and send the new revision as a non-RFC series
since RQSC has been ratified.

Qemu is important for testing the RISC-V QoS support in Linux [2],
because I'm not aware of any hardware yet that supports all 4 features
of CBQRI: capacity allocation, capacity monitoring, bandwidth
allocation, and bandwidth monitoring. Ascalon only supports capacity
allocation, and I have not seen public details from other vendors about
which CBQRI features have been implemented.

Thanks,
Drew

Yes sure, just brainstorming here, to help Yonggang moving forward with

How can we deduce this information (bitness or target for existing
machines/cpus)?
Also, how to deal with devices that are only available for some targets,
but not others, depending on various Kconfig knobs?

We could also not register them as virt if more than one target is
detected, so people have to call explicitly aarch64-virt.
Would that be a possible way to move forward?

Fine for me. Just want to see how things will be before spending the
effort to review many patches when outcome is uncertain.

No, on the contrary, that's all good stuff.

What I'm considering here is the behaviour of the new proposed
qemu-system and what it needs to be able todo.

Some of this work only appears relevant to a scenario where
qemu-system-$target is dropped in favour of a symlink to the
new qemu-system. That forces qemu-system to be 100% compatible
with the existing binaries, which IMHO is an undesirable
constraint and creates extra work.

We can have the benefits of the compliation unit reduction,
cleaner headers, etc, while still having qemu-system be a
distinct break with the past in a number of areas.

It isn't about the syntax - whether it is implicit from the binary
name or explicit from -target, that's still producing a design
where the target is the top level concept, and machine is a second
level concept. I don't see how that makes sense given the longer
term intent to have machines with heterogeneous CPU targets.

The machine looks like it should be the top level concept, with
target(s) derived from that.

The machine names need to be globally unique across all targets.
So the 'virt' naming clash needs a rename, such as is done in
an earlier patch in this series.

With the requirement that machine names are globally unique, we can
determine the target(s) directly.

Relying on argv(0) does not appear to work in a heterogeneous future
as target is no longer unique per process, but the machine type would
be unique.

With regards,
Daniel

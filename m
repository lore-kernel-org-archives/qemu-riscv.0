I read that text but understood it describes what is done now and missed 
the part where it says how to pick a parent.

OK so this is clear for a SoC or a multifunction device where we mostly do 
that now, for example hw/isa/vt82c686.c has object_initialize_child for 
its parts (which is the only reason we need an init method and could do 
without it otherwise). For PPC460EX we don't model the SoC as this is old 
code that was cleaned up a bit but never completed to convert everything 
so the machine still creates the SoC parts and wires them as a lot of 
older machines did. I intended to improve the PCIe emulation on sam460ex 
and clean up that part during that but haven't got to it yet. I guess 
other devices like isa have the same problem that they predate even QOM so 
was not fully converted yet.

What should own sysbus devices? The machine? Or is it the bus which owns 
the devices connected to it? Another problem is that machines usually use 
convenience functions to create devices such as sysbus_create_simple and 
pci_create_simple so if these devices need to be attached to the machine 
then these convenience functions should take care of that not the board 
code. It's rare that a device does object_new or object_initialize to get 
a device and it would be inconvenient to then cast the result to object 
and parent it somewhere where the functions that created the device could 
do this.

As you say does not matter what is it called if it's just a handle.

Never seen such error message. Usually errors also say what device it is 
from so usually straightforward to know where it comes from.

Never needed to use device-sync-config. It's not even documented at 
https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/monitor.html#qemu-monitor so I 
have no idea what this command does. Found some info here:
https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/devel/qdev-api.html but I don't know 
about any device implementing that so it's probably a rare thing.

> Further questions?

Basically the question was why should I think about this if things work 
now and nobody complained about it so it looked like it just bothers you 
that there are some unparented objects that could be put in some other 
category, but it's not a real issue for any common problem other than 
esthetics. I'm OK with solving that within QOM or qdev or somewhere where 
I don't have to think about it when writing board code. Imposing it on the 
board code looks like additional complexity and yet another thing to 
confuse new people trying to create a machine so unless there's a good 
reason to require that I'd do without it.

Where are stable QOM paths needed? If you can't predict them and still 
need to query it first then it likely does not matter what is the path as 
it's just used to query and refer to a device as a handle so in that case 
we may just forget the path hierarchy and make it flat and that would also 
solve your issue with unparented devices.

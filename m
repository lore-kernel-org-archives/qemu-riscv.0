Hi Philippe,
Fair point. Users shouldn=E2=80=99t need to know about other targets to use=
 ARM
virt. Keep the machine name as virt; target selection in a combined
binary should be separate from -machine. This series doesn=E2=80=99t choose=
 that
interface. With no target selected, help can list machines across targets,
but QEMU must not choose one arbitrarily.

Hi Philippe,

You=E2=80=99re right: I haven=E2=80=99t clearly explained what I=E2=80=99m =
trying to achieve, and
I=E2=80=99m sorry for not answering your questions sooner.

My goal is specifically to let a combined binary list all target-specific
machines when the target is none. This is for inspection, not for
selecting an arbitrary machine to run. Today, linking machines from
different targets hits QOM type-name conflicts. This series gives the
machine classes unique QOM names while preserving their familiar machine
names.

Pierrick=E2=80=99s series adds targets to a single linked binary and filter=
s
machines according to the selected target. Its do not care about
machine listing for target "none". These patches address that separate
case and the QOM-name conflicts; they are not intended to conflict with
Pierrick=E2=80=99s target-selection work.

I=E2=80=99m not proposing argv-based target inference or a new -target inte=
rface
in this series. qemu-system-$arch is currently a separate executable,
not a symlink to qemu-system, so argv-based selection is outside this
work. This series do not conflict with either "-target $arch -machine $mach=
ine"
or "-machine $arch:$machine"

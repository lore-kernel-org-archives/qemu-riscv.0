Gross.

I do when I have a kernel with microsemi PCI Support (specifically the
one included in the bbl you sent us a while back).

It's a qemu problem in that people will want to be able to actually use
qemu... somehow. It has to be documented what's required here. You can't
just say that the sifive_u machine won't work and it's someone else's
problem. People using qemu will not be able to figure out there are bbl
issues.

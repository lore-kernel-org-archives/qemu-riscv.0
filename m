My motivation behind renaming the xml files was to work against the 
misconception that e.g. 64bit-cpu and 64bit-fpu are related to one another. 
But of course, 32bit-fpu and 64bit-fpu is technically not incorrect.

Regarding the removal of the fp csrs from the csr list: I found it confusing 
that the fp csr registers were listed in two files. In addition the bitsize of 
the fp csr registers was stated as 64 in riscv-64bit-csr.xml, wheras the other 
xml files (32bit-csr, 32bit-fpu and 64bit-fpu) stated 32, in accordance with 
the RISC-V ISA specification.
Then I had a look at the gdb source code, and came to the conclusion that gdb 
does not use the fp csr registers from the org.gnu.gdb.riscv.csr feaure set, 
but instead the ones from org.gnu.gdb.riscv.fpu. Therefore, I decided to 
remove the fp csr registers from the csr list.
However, as I don't have any prior experience with QEMU or gdb development is 
quite likely that I misinterpreted or overlooked something.

For now I prepared a third version of the patch that only fixes the rvf/rvd 
32/64-bit support.

"is_available" is probably a bit overkill as a mechanism for
introspecting, when we just need to return a list of targets,
Since we have that already we might as well use it initially
though.

Yeah, I'm leaning more towards always exposing the $arch-virt names
in all binaries, and also exposing 'virt' in the traditional
binaries only.

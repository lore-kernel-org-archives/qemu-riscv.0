*If* we take the starting assumption that the new multi-target
binary does not need to be a perfect replica of the existing
binaries, then filtering devices is creating extra work for
ourselves, to solve a problem that isn't especially important.

Even with the current per-target binaries there are countless
devices linked in which are incompatible / not usable with
certain machine types. A new multi-target binary with a union
of all devices will just be a bigger example of a scenario that
already has to be dealt with for today's binaries.

So if we have that assumption that we don't need to do device
filtering, at that point, a --target option doesn't have as
big of a role to play. The machine type code knows what target(s)
it wants (1 or 2 targets depending on if there are 32 + 64 bit
varaints. The CPU model the user requests (if the CPU is not
hardcoded by the machine), determines 32 bit vs 64 bit.

A --target option (or similar -machine name,target=xxx) could
be used to dis-ambiguate between 'virt' machines if keeping
their user facing machine names as-is, or it could be used as
a way to be more explicit about the 32-bit vs 64-bit choice
and sanity checked against the CPU model choice.

So overall "device filtering" or not is the key question to
decide IMHO.

With regards,
Daniel

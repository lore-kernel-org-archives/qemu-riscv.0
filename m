This is also why I post these patches, i've already enabled better modules
support, so we can implement devices in dll(win32/linux/osx) all works.
I achieve that by introducing a new plugin and getting the memory to be
more configable. so that we can bind the device to dma-memory by option,
not by link.

.7 MB which<br>&gt; &gt; is about 15% increase. NB this is dirty, private R=
AM per<br>&gt; &gt; process. The shared RAM pages also increase but that&#3=
9;s not<br>&gt; &gt; a concern since they&#39;re common to all QEMU process=
es.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; qemu-system-aarch64 shows a much smaller RAM =
increase, since<br>&gt; &gt; it only grew from 1430 classes to 1530 classes=
.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; We have many more target though, so if we assum=
e the end<br>&gt; &gt; point where every single target is unified, the the =
union<br>&gt; &gt; of all classes for all targets comes to approx 3600.<br>=
&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; My guesstimate is that would mean a memory increase =
for<br>&gt; &gt; qemu-system-riscv64 from 17.3 to 39.9 MB, which is a<br>&g=
t; &gt; 72% increase.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; In absolute terms this is s=
till modest, but for deployments<br>&gt; &gt; with large VM counts =C2=A0an=
d small RAM sizes, that gets to be<br>&gt; &gt; significant.<br>&gt; &gt;<b=
r>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; None of this means single binary is a bad idea.<br=
>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; My main takeaway is that we&#39;re cre=
ating uneccessary work<br>&gt; &gt; for ourselves by trying to make &#39;qe=
mu-sytem&#39; identical<br>&gt; &gt; in behaviour to qemu-system-$TARGET.<b=
r>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; The complex filtering patches / QOM interfaces tha=
t I<br>&gt; &gt; found uncomfortable in Pierrick&#39;s base series are larg=
ely<br>&gt; &gt; around the filtering needed to simulate qemu-system-$TARGE=
T,<br>&gt; &gt; and they&#39;re still incomplete. I don&#39;t have high con=
fidence<br>&gt; &gt; in our ability to avoid regressions if we go route thi=
s<br>&gt; &gt; route.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; IMHO we should=
 make a clean break with the past. Leave<br>&gt; &gt; the existing qemu-sys=
tem-$TARGET binaries being built<br>&gt; &gt; from the same pieces they are=
 today, such that there<br>&gt; &gt; is better confidence that we are not m=
aking behavioural<br>&gt; &gt; changes to them.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<b=
r>&gt; &gt; qemu-system should be built alongside qemu-system-$TARGET<br>&g=
t; &gt; and offer new semantics where it is documented as exposing<br>&gt; =
&gt; everything from all targets whenever introspected and does<br>&gt; &gt=
; not apply target type or target Kconfig filtering to inputs/<br>&gt; &gt;=
 outputs.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; We still get the benefit of only buildi=
ng most =C2=A0.o files<br>&gt; &gt; once, so keeping qemu-system-$TARGET is=
 only a small<br>&gt; &gt; overhead in the final step of linking everything=
 together.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; qemu-system will still ha=
ve the increased memory overhead<br>&gt; &gt; but that&#39;s fine as qemu-s=
ystem-$TARGET will be unaffected.<br>&gt; &gt; We can tackle the memory ove=
rhead of qemu-system at our<br>&gt; &gt; leisure through use of loadable mo=
dules, and thus not have<br>&gt; &gt; that as a task to think about today.<=
br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; With the clean break with the past, =
we also have the<br>&gt; &gt; ability to tackle various long standing desig=

There are a few machines using some others but these are the most used. 
That suggests maybe we should change the convenience wrappers to match 
what machines need but DEFINE_MACHINE_EXTENDED is meant to be the one that 
allows all parameters which should be rarely needed.

Not necessarily. The SECURE parameter did that to preserve previous 
behaviour but if you add new parameter changing all callers (which is the 
same as expanding the macro that would also change all callers) then it's 
just a new parameter added not changing the number of DEFINE_MACHINE* 
wrappers. Rearranging the wrappers to make DEFINE_MACHINE_EXTENDED used 
less is an independent change.

But that defies the purpose of hiding the QOM boiler plate as much as 
possible. New people are confused by QOM and it's easier for them to look 
up documentation on the DEFINE_MACHINE* macros to see what parameter is 
what and not care about how it's stored in QOM TypeInfo or what is that 
at all.

The parameter also has a name and documentation so it's not simpler to 
look up TypeInfo than look at the macro definition or docs. In fact it's 
harder to guess from TypeInfo as then you also need to get into QOM.

That means exposing all the boiler plate for all machines other than the 
simplest case. I think it would be better to keep DEFINE_MACHINE_EXTENDED 
but maybe rethink the existing wrappers and drop unused ones and maybe add 
new ones that reduce the usage of DEFINE_MACHINE_EXTENDED but still keep 
the boiler plate hidden.

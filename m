Ok

Or could the 'none' machine simply report '0xffffffff' for the
list of targets so it includes everything today & in the future,
or specialize "0" to mean everything ?

I'm confident that we will find badly behaviour devices,
but we don't need to fix it all upfront, and they would
arguably be considered buggy already today.

Yes.

One idea I had was that when define the 'virt' class type we could
have a way to identify whether it is linked into the traditional
binaries, or linked into the multi-target binary, and from
that choose what name to register it under. eg

  "extern bool multi_target;"

and have two .c files, one setting it 'true' and one 'false',
and link each to the respective binaries. So we know statically
before main() has even run, what mode this binary is intended
to operate in.

Yes, that's another viable option. Always register '$arch-virt' and
only register 'virt' for traditional binaries.

Well, for qtest I rely a lot on the maintainers of the actual code being
tested knowing what they're doing, I can't keep up with every single
test that's added, so I think even somewhat trivial shuffling of code
would be disruptive. You're probably quite used to dealing with these
things during normal (non-test) backporting, so it's probably fine.

Right, but this requires carrying stable-only patches, which makes me
confused. Again, my own lack of understanding.

Sure, if you think the effort is not that big, having tests makes
everything easier, I agree.

For PPC460EX we don't model the SoC as this is old code that was cleaned up a bit but never completed to convert everything so the machine still creates the SoC parts and wires them as a lot of older machines did. I intended to improve the PCIe emulation on sam460ex and clean up that part during that but haven't got to it yet. I guess other devices like isa have the same problem that they predate even QOM so was not fully converted yet.

Yes, many of the early conversions were superficial.

Once problematic code exists, it gets imitated.  We shouldn't blame the
victims.

> What should own sysbus devices? The machine? Or is it the bus which owns the devices connected to it?

If the sysbus device is part of another device, it should be below it in
the composition tree.  Whether to connect it directly or via its bus is
arguably a matter of taste.  Would be nice if we could agree on a
convention there.

If it's not part of another device (say a chip soldered onto the
mainboard), then put it into /machine with a sensible name.

> Another problem is that machines usually use convenience functions to create devices such as sysbus_create_simple and pci_create_simple so if these devices need to be attached to the machine then these convenience functions should take care of that not the board code. It's rare that a device does object_new or object_initialize to get a device and it would be inconvenient to then cast the result to object and parent it somewhere where the functions that created the device could do this.

Alex Graf just posted RFC patches "qom: Make composition-tree parenting
mandatory".  I haven't hat a chance to examine them, but patch titles
suggest the series takes care of that.

True!  Still, nice names help humans with debugging and such.  We should
go for them whenever practical.

Such error messages definitely exist.  Random pick,
hw/net/can/flexcan.c:

            error_setg(errp, "%s: flexcan_connect_to_bus failed",
                       dev->canonical_path);

Many trace points and log entries show canonical QOM paths, too.

To learn what a QMP command does, start with the "QEMU QMP Reference
Manual".  All commands are documented there, or else QEMU fails to
build.  Can't enforce the documentation to be *good*, though.  So if you
find something that's bad, post a patch or file a bug.

If my point was "device-sync-config needs this", an argument "who cares
for device-sync-config" could perhaps be made.  It is not.  My point is
that canonical QOM paths are part of external interfaces *by design*.
device-sync-config is merely the first example I found for use of QOM
paths in QMP input.

I'm OK with solving that within QOM or qdev or somewhere where I don't have to think about it when writing board code. Imposing it on the board code looks like additional complexity and yet another thing to confuse new people trying to create a machine so unless there's a good reason to require that I'd do without it.

Once again: they are part of external interfaces.

> If you can't predict them and still need to query it first then it likely does not matter what is the path as it's just used to query and refer to a device as a handle so in that case we may just forget the path hierarchy and make it flat and that would also solve your issue with unparented devices.

That's not how QOM works.

You are welcome to propose a redesign of QOM.

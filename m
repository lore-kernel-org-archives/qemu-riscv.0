Unfortunately, I don't have the time to teach a class on QOM basics
today.  The text you quoted explains what QOM parent and canonical QOM
path are, albeit briefly.  It also explains how to pick the QOM parent
properly, what happens when you neglect to pick one, and why that's
undesirable.  I'm going to elaborate a bit.

A fully constructed QOM object is part of the QOM composition tree.
This is a fundamental property of QOM's design.

A QOM object can be composed of sub-objects.  Its sub-objects are its
children in the composition tree.  That's why it's named *composition*
tree.

Canonical QOM paths are visible at external interfaces both as input and
as output.  A few quick examples:

* QMP command query-cpus-fast reports a CPU's canonical QOM path.  For
  some machines, we get something like "/machine/unattached/device[0]".
  Fine as long as the client treats it as an opaque handle.  For other
  machines, we get something like "/machine/soc/cpu", which is clearly
  better.

* Error messages use canonical QOM paths to identify devices.  With
  properly modeled hardware, these paths are actually helpful for
  humans.  Something like "/machine/unattached/device[7]" not so much.

* QMP command device-sync-config accepts a QOM path argument.  With
  properly modeled hardware, you can use a stable canonical QOM path.
  But when the device is in the /machine/unattached orphanage, its
  canonical QOM path is unstable.  A client has to first search the
  orphanage to find today's path.

Further questions?

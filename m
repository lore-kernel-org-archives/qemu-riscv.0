I agree it does not scale. It creates friction both for you and people
who submit in the subsystem.

Then simply apply a FIFO strategy. Take series as they come, and leave
conflicting one out. IMHO, it should not be the responsibility of a
maintainer.

How about merging things to master fast enough so people can just rebase
on master? It seems like it would solve both people problems, and yours
also. No need to do any rebase, and no wait time for developers.

The only thing it requires is to increase PR frequency, and I would even
go as far as suggesting to send one PR per series if you want to provide
the best velocity possible for this subsystem. Just automate the push
and CI triggering, so it does not take more than 2 min of your time.

When a conflict happen or a test fail, simply ask "please rebase/fix",
and wait for the next version. Not your problem anymore.

What do you think?

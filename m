Introduce a new function, sfence_vma_allowed(), to handle
privilege/hypervisor checks currently performed in helper_tlb_flush(),
and make use of it in that function. Then, add helper_tlb_flush_page()
for flushing only a single TLB page, using sfence_vma_allowed() inside
it similarly to with helper_tlb_flush(). Finally, rework the
trans_sfence_vma() function to use helper_tlb_flush_page() when rs1 !=
0.

The third patch also includes the fix for a regression in the
'test_tuxrun.TuxRunRiscV64Test.test_riscv64_maxcpu' test encountered
with the draft version of this series, which hanged indefinitely until
killed when the patches were applied. This was fixed by making sure to
use get_address() to canonicalize the address being passed to
helper_tlb_flush_page().

make-check and make-functional were both run with the patches applied on
master, and no regressions for riscv64 were observed (beyond the one
mentioned as fixed above). 

Daniel Barboza helped me with initial triage, direction, and cleaning up
this series for submission - thanks again!

Some background context: as part of the RISE Project[1] mission to
improve the RISC-V software ecosystem, the Yocto Project[2] is receiving
assistance with triaging bugs and enhancing RISC-V support in the core
layer. The 'qemuriscv32' and 'qemuriscv64' targets were enabled as part
of the Yocto's CI system, known as the Autobuilder[3] in 2025, and since
that time various intermittent failures have been observed on the
'ptest' ('package test', where a package's test suites are bundled into
an image and then booted to do basic runtime compatibility testing)
case, 'qemuriscv64-ptest'. These almost always manifest as timeouts in
the guest, usually around heavier and/or more complex test cases, and
they additionally seem to occur only under heavy host system (x86_64)
load. 

Comparing to other major architectures like x86_64 and arm64, the
riscv64 guests are always emulated in TCG mode, since the Yocto
Autobuilder cluster does not (yet) have native riscv64 hosts to dedicate
for runtime testing with kvm support. While this is likely a major
factor in why qemuriscv64 runs fail at higher rates than other
architectures, it was noted after compiling the triage data[4] that
local comparisons of the same ptest images running on TCG-mode qemuarm64
and qemuriscv64 showed the latter taking significantly longer to
complete (using some of the test suites which have been observed failing
as examples), even with no other meaningful system load on the host. In
particular, the coreutils case showed over 70% longer runtime for
qemuriscv64 compared to qemuarm64 (~1000s vs ~580s).

Fully investigating the source of this discrepancy was a long process.
For Yocto builds, native QEMU binaries are built from source as part of
the overall image build, so the first place to look was in QEMU's
configuration and boot options. Other suggestions included trying to
disable TCG plugins or alter the QEMU and guest package configs (Yocto's
QEMU is RVA23S64 profile by default, while the runtime packages are
built for riscv64gc). However, these changes either produced no
meaningful effect or actually increased runtime. The next step was to
investigate the QEMU source, which is what ultimately led to this patch
series. It turns out that these changes significantly improve the
reference runtime test case for coreutils in Yocto, although it is still
somewhat slower than in qemuarm64. It remains to be seen whether these
changes to the QEMU source eliminate the intermittent issues in Yocto's
testing, but it is a meaningful improvement which opens the door to
further optimizations for RISC-V.

As an example, compare the before and after results on a local run of
core-image-ptest-coreutils for qemuriscv64:

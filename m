I think I'm lost and cannot follow what you want. As far as I understood 
you want to add a new field "target" to machine TypeInfo but instead of 
adding that straight away you proposed to first add is_available then 
later replace that with target. I asked why do you need is_available and 
not add target right away?

Then if this target parameter will be needed for all machines why can't 
you add that to all DEFINE_MACHINE macros as a required parameter and set 
it for all machines passing it through to DEFINE_MACHINE_EXTENDED which 
sets in the TypeInfo. That way no machines need changing other than adding 
the target parameter to the existing DEFINE_MACHINE calls.

What am I missing?

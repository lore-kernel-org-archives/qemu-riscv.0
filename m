Keeping DRAM configuration as part of a separate ROM booting stage prior
to the U-Boot SPL sounds good to me. This will lead to following boot-flow:

ROM/HSS (M-mode) => U-Boot SPL (M-mode) => OpenSBI (M-mode) => U-Boot S-mode

Maybe as a PHASE1 patch series for PolarFire U-Boot support can
target the following:
1. Minimal U-Boot board support for PolarFire IcIcle Board with
single defconfig to build both U-Boot SPL and U-Boot S-mode
2. Serial port driver (probably re-use existing driver)
3. SD and eMMC driver

Supporting SD booting is highly desirable for PHASE1. At least,
U-Boot SPL, OpenSBI, U-Boot S-mode, and Linux should come
as separate images from SD card. The ROM/HSS can reside and
boot from on-board flash/eMMC.

Above is my suggestion based on experience with SiFive Unleashed.

The general idea behind OpenSource boot-flow is to have each
booting stage as a separate binary so that users can selectively
upgrade a particular booting stage without re-compiling/re-flashing
other booting stages.

Various distros and yocto already support building most of the above
booting stages (U-Boot, OpenSBI, Linux, etc) so we can reuse a lot
of existing work. Eventually, I am confident we will endup moving
more stuff from ROM/HSS to U-Boot SPL for ease in maintenance.

Anup
